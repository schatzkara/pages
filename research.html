                        <li> Collaborating with researchers on the ARAGORN team at RENCI, who developed the large-scale biomedical graph called ROBOKOP, to computationally search the graph for potentially promising drug-repurposing hypotheses, or drug-disease relationships that may lead to treatment development after confirming clinical trials. I have been working specifically on knowledge graph inference rule generation for ARAGORN’s “creative-mode” queries, which enable users to query a node pair of interest to them; if no relationship between them exists in ROBOKOP, then inference rules are applied in succession to identify any possible inferred connection between the node pair. The ARAGORN team has begun collaborations with the non-profit Every Cure, which will bring the drug-repurposing hypotheses generated to clinical trials for further drug development. </li>

                        <li> Developed an approach to abstract, or compress, knowledge graphs in such a way that very little information is lost. In this way, the abstract knowledge graph can be used for more efficient analytics, while not sacrificing much of the effectiveness of the analytics or their results. Tested knowledge graph inference rule mining on the compressed graphs and found that the mining stage is significantly faster, but very few inference rules are lost on the compressed graphs. </li>

                        <li> Developed an approach to mine metapaths from knowledge graphs in a ping-pong style with domain scientists as humans-in-the-loop. The approach uses pairs of related and unrelated nodes and mine metapaths that bring the related nodes together in latent embedding space, while driving the unrelated nodes apart. In this way, the metapaths discovered provide some semantic reasoning about the relation between the node pairs. </li>

During the integration the appropriate standard-level data that contributes to the summary-level data is identified and maintained as provenance to enable efficient and effective querying of both the data and provenance after integration. Specifically worked on the problem formalism and well as helping to develop the approach. </li>

                        <li> Developed the notion of promiscuity in knowledge graphs, which is related to node degree and connectivity. Devised an algorithm for finding least promiscuous paths in knowledge graphs, which have been found to be more interesting to domain scientists than promiscuous paths. Specifically worked on helping to create the algorithm and worked heavily on the formalism of promiscuity an promiscuous path-searching. </li>

Through web-scraping and database cross-referencing, we have refined all the semantic triples to now include clear entity names, relationship types, and other desired attributes. Overall, this makes the knowledge graph more usable for analysis, especially for biomedical researchers and users, since the data can be understood. </li>

                        <li> Designed a domain-agnostic approach for extracting and evaluating explanations from knowledge graphs for proposed hypotheses. The approach derives explanations via backward-chaining using knowledge graph triples and inference rules to justify the truth of the hypotheses. The explanation-evaluation metrics offer a global evaluation of each explanation based on existing evidence in the knowledge graph. We tested the approach on the biomedical application of explaining and evaluating drug-repurposing hypotheses, and we collaborated with biomedical experts to study the domain reasonableness of our output. </li>
